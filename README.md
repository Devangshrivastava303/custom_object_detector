✅ GitHub Project Description (README intro)
🔍 Real-Time Object Detection Web App
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for real-time object detection using a custom-trained TensorFlow model deployed on a web interface. The app captures webcam input, runs inference using the TensorFlow Object Detection API, and displays live detections on a browser through a Flask backend.

🚀 Features
Custom-trained SSD MobileNet v2 model using TensorFlow

Live webcam object detection with bounding boxes and labels

Flask backend with streaming via OpenCV

Responsive HTML/CSS frontend styled for an AI-themed UI

Modular structure: separate files for dataset prep, training, detection, and web app

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.9

TensorFlow 2.x
